Saron Looper
==

If you never find or meet Saron before, I'm honored to introduce you one of the instruments of Gamelan, [Saron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saron_(instrument).

> "Yet it is no more necessary to have real or imitation instruments in order to reap the benegits of gamelan that it is for a composer to use actual Indonesian music to demonstrate an affinity with it", -Mantle Hood

Before you try the real instrument, you might want to try it through this software "Saron Looper" as simulation. "Saron Looper" is when Saron simulator meets loop station.
